			+ "have been selected, click the Schedule button to begin the scheduling process. The scheduler "
			+ "will run to generate a new schedule and alert you when the application is finished running. The "
			+ "output file will contain the time, day, and room that a lesson will be held along with the names "
			+ "of the teacher and student and which instrument they selected. If there is an error with the "
